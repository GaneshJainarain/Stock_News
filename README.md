# A program to get news pertaining to Stocks

### Getting Stock data from reliable and credible sources
- (CNBC, TheStreet, Bloomberg, SeekingAlpha, MarketWatch, Benzinga, etc...)
- What do all of these websites have in common? On all of their home-pages there are many different sections pertaining to different kinds of news, mostly economical and stock news. We could write a program to scrape the data we want or we can see if one of these websites has an API that we can use making our life easier when it comes to actually retrieving the data we want. 

### Once we have gotten said stock news data we can use NLP
- Natural Language Processing on Stock News Headlines
    - Assign a value and a score(Positive, Neutral, Negative)
    - These values will help us understand the sentiment of a news headline
